### Copyright stuff

I do not own any of the mods in the modpack, and they are all a part of the modrinth ecosystem. You can look at each mod's details page in the modrinth app. Feel free to use the mods in the modpack in your own pack, but DO NOT directly rip our modpack for your own smp.

*I Aint Reading Allat (IARA): basically dont steal our modpack plz*
